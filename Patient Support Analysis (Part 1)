UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“
whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.
Write a query to find how many UHG policy holders made three, or more calls, assuming each call is identified by the case_id column.

solution :     
With caller as 
(select policy_holder_id, count(case_id) from callers
group by policy_holder_id
having count(case_id) >= 3
)
select count(policy_holder_id) as policyholdercount
from  caller
